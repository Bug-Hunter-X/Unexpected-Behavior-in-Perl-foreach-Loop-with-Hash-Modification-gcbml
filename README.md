This repository demonstrates an uncommon Perl bug related to modifying a hash during iteration using a foreach loop. The bug.pl file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.pl offers a corrected version. The issue arises because Perl's foreach loop on a hash creates a copy of the keys; therefore, directly deleting or modifying the hash within the loop leads to unexpected results. The solution involves creating a separate list of keys or iterating in a different way to avoid the issue.
